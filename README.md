# Banner Kings: Cultures Expanded

## FAQ
***What is this mod?***
Banner Kings: Cultures Expanded is the official expansion to the Banner Kings mod. It contains our lore and game-world interpretation. In the same spirit of Banner Kings, this interpretation aims to be lore-accurate to the Mount & Blade world (not just Bannerlord), while expanding on gaps left by the creators.

***What does it do?***
- Addition of several religions to BK religions system;
- Cultural flavor through endonym kingdom names, custom population and title names;
- Overhaul of all cultures and minor clan troop trees;
- Addition and extension of existing sub-cultures to have gameplay relevance, such as Vakken, Nord and Darshi cultures;
- (Planned) Map changes with the addition of a few new settlements, including some of new cultures, rebalanced village production types;
- (Planned) Large-scale invasions from off-map lore cultures, such as Darshi and Nords, with full cultural and religious flavor.

***Does it work with X mod?***
If the mod has overlapping features, no. Troops mod? No. Factions mod? No. ATC? No.

## Cultures

### Battanian
The misty hills of north-western Calradia are dominated by the Battanian clans, the original inhabitants of much of the continent. Their hilltop fortresses have born witness to countless wars fought to resist outside invaders: first the Empire's legions, and more recently the rising Sturgian and Vlandian kingdoms. They are masters of the longbow, the night raid, the sudden wild charge out of the woods. They idolise valour, but especially like it when mixed with a bit of mischief - the cattle thief who can whisk an entire herd into the fog; the champion who dines with a rival tribe, and, regaling his hosts with an anecdote of battle, produces from his bag the skull of one of their kinsmen that he took as a souvenir.

### Vlandic
The first Vlandians arrived from overseas, mercenaries and adventurers, speaking the tongues of many lands, taking the empire's silver to guard the frontiers against the unsubdued tribes of the interior. They took their name from one of their first warlords, Wilund the Bold - Valandion, in Calradic - and became known as the Vlandians. Their heavy cavalry, second to none, ran down the Emperor's foes from the Aserai wastes to the distant steppes. But cash-strapped officials soon began to pay them with land grants and titles instead of silver, perhaps not the most far-sighted of policies. The Vlandians settled, married, planted farms, and seized nearby imperial fortresses as their own. Now they are an independent kingdom, their traditions drawing from both Calradia and their distant homelands.
