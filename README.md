# Banner Kings: Cultures Expanded

## FAQ
***What is this mod?***
Banner Kings: Cultures Expanded is the official expansion to the Banner Kings mod. It contains our lore and game-world interpretation. In the same spirit of Banner Kings, this interpretation aims to be lore-accurate to the Mount & Blade world (not just Bannerlord), while expanding on gaps left by the creators.

***What does it do?***
- Addition of several religions to BK religions system;
- Cultural flavor through endonym kingdom names, custom population and title names;
- Overhaul of all cultures and minor clan troop trees;
- Addition and extension of existing sub-cultures to have gameplay relevance, such as Vakken, Nord and Darshi cultures;
- (Planned) Map changes with the addition of a few new settlements, including some of new cultures, rebalanced village production types;
- (Planned) Large-scale invasions from off-map lore cultures, such as Darshi and Nords, with full cultural and religious flavor.


***Does it work with X mod?***
If the mod has overlapping features, no. Troops mod? No. Factions mod? No. ATC? No.
